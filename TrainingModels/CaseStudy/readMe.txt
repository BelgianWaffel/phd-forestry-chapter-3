Data provided for the tutorial case study is hypothetical and is not
current information for the study area (which represents somewhere
in the B.C. interior). 

This data is similar to the kind of information used in complex landscape models.

The following is included in the CaseStudy files

(a) gisData folder: Spatial information:
      resolution is 1 ha (cells are 100m x 100m)
      exent: about 418,000 ha

(b)   dataDictionary.xls: spreadsheet that described the spatial layers provided

(c)   cats folder: some legends (legends may also be attached to GeoTiff files)

(d)   grids: GeoTiff files


Several tutorial models make use of this data and models, in particular (Modules 3 and 7).

Module 7 incrementally builds increasingly complex models, starting from a very simple 
habitat suitability index (v1_HSI) to a more complex model with fires, agigng, logging and roads (v7_roads).
